# System Design Concepts i Know,

DNS (Domain Name System) – translates domain names to IP addresses.

Load Balancer – distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

Server – hosts your application or service.

API Gateway – entry point for clients; handles routing, authentication, rate limiting.

Fan-out – one request triggering multiple downstream requests.

CDN (Content Delivery Network) – caches static content closer to users for faster delivery.

Vertical Scaling – increasing the resources of a single server (CPU, RAM, storage).

Horizontal Scaling – adding more servers to handle increased load.

IP Address – unique identifier for devices on a network.

OSI Model – conceptual model with 7 layers explaining network communication:

Queue System / Asynchronous Processing – using message queues to process tasks asynchronously, improving scalability and responsiveness (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS).

Caching – storing frequently accessed data for faster retrieval (e.g., Redis, Memcached, CDN cache).

Serverless – running code without managing servers; cloud provider handles scaling and execution (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions).

Spiking – sudden surge in traffic or workload that can overload servers if the system isn’t designed to handle it (e.g., Black Friday sale, viral content).
